The Morse Code Converter project aims to provide a versatile tool for translating text to Morse code and vice versa. The primary use case involves users wanting to encode messages for privacy (e.g., Amy's private diary) or decode received Morse code (e.g., Peter deciphering a letter). The project adheres to the Strategy design pattern, allowing dynamic selection of conversion strategies at runtime. Users stories include Amy secretly writing her diary in Morse code and Peter decoding received messages. The program showcases clean architecture principles, ensuring modularity and testability. It also enables custom mapping of characters to Morse code, supporting extensibility. These design choices uphold SOLID principles, enhancing code quality and maintainability, and the included tests ensure robustness and accuracy in the conversion processes.
